Source code that I had created for the Spinosaurous rig originally


Please drop in ALL files into your maya scripts or use the example code to edit to make it grab from any place on your computer as desired.

Go here if you want to see how to make this code accessible beyond the maya script folder from my created example:https://github.com/SKetchPoint/TestMayaPython

Zip file contains all of the py files within it. Please go to the main dino ui python file and run that to get the 3 tabs for the tool collection
